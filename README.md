This is just to demonstrate creating a linked list from user inputs and how to manipulate them.

Problem 1: Reverse a linked list

Problem 2: Given a linked list and number m and n, return it back with only positions m to n in reverse.

Problem 3: Given a doubly linked list, list nodes also have a child property than can point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists can also have one or more child doubly linked list of their own and so on...
Return the list as single level frattened doubly linked list.
